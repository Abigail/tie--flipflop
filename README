NAME
    Tie::FlipFlop - Alternate between two values.

SYNOPSIS
        use Tie::FlipFlop;

        tie my $flipflop => Tie::FlipFlop => qw /Red Green/;

        print  $flipflop;      # Prints 'Red'.
        print  $flipflop;      # Prints 'Green'.
        print  $flipflop;      # Prints 'Red'.

DESCRIPTION
    "Tie::FlipFlop" allows you to tie a scalar in such a way that refering
    to the scalar alternates between two values. When tying the scalar,
    exactly two extra arguments have to be given, the values to be
    alternated between.

    Assigning to the scalar leads to a fatal, but trappable, error.
